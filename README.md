Matching Game

Matching Game is a simple interactive game, with rules, based on popular game "Concentration". It is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. The game can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well. 

Install

The game doesn't require any additional installation. You can start to play by clicking on file “index.html”. Also, you can drag-and-drop it to your browser.

Issues

Considering audio-playing policy, the sound-track for the game starts playing just after the first click on the deck of cards.

Rules

1. Chooses two cards and click on them – they will be turned down.
2. If they are of the same rank and color (e.g. both of bolt or of diamonds) then they will be fixed open.
3. If they are not of the same rank, they will be turned face down again.
4. It is impossible to click more then 2 cards at the same time.
5. The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.
